  - My personal mission is to <b>make things, fix stuff and help others</b>.<br/> I just happened to love working with high tech stuff so it became my area of expertise.
  - I am a <b>detail oriented</b> and <b>challenge driven</b> person so I never leave a stone unturned or a question unanswered.<br/>
    <strike>I care</strike> I am passionate about what I do and I work hard for things that are worth it.<br/>
    Insatiably curious, I am a <b>quick and self taught learner</b> that thrives on picking up and mastering new topics. I take a <b>multi-disciplined approach</b> to my work, incorporating ideas from the several aspects of my skillset.
    Asking 'what if' is something I do as often as possible, making sure everything has been thought of, and, in the process challenging myself and my teammates. I experiment constantly.
  - I have <b>over 10 years of experience</b> in telecommunications, server infrastructures and carrier-grade network design & build. Bleeding edge software technologies have become parts of my toolset to create powerful and unique infrastructures. I eat DevOps for breakfast.<br/>
    Feel free to <a href="#sections-04-skills" class="page-scroll">Scroll down</a> for more details.
  - The world is full of "things" waiting to be built, and I love being that guy who makes them come into being. <br/>
    So, let's talk about that huge [problem/idea/project/goal] you dream of, and let's see how I can help!
