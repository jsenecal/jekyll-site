      - While I was at EBOX I was responsible for the restructuration and scalability of everything IT -
        EBOX was undergoing tremendous growth and I had to ensure the systems and network would survive it.
      - "A new datacenter was under construction and I lead the team responsible for its realization with the different vendors and contractors.
        My mission: ensure it would withstand future growth, for years to come."
      - I also managed the developpement team and designed an authentication and access control system for a client-facing service.
        The system restricts content depending on a client's subscription and limits the number of devices a client can use to access the service.
        Due to the kind of content it protected, the system, written in Python, was designed to allow for extreme scalability.
      - My previous experience in building networks was put to good use to help EBOX upgrade their infrastructure to offer value added services based on MPLS technologies
    points:
      - Managed and improved a business critical infrastructure providing services to 100k+ clients
      - Designed and managed the construction of a datacenter using state of the art equipment and technologies
      - Initiated and managed a software development project that provided ways to deliver new services to grow the business
      - Introduced the key concepts of the DevOps toolchain to the software development team to allow for more reliable development of applications

    title: Director, Research and Developpement
    text:
      - The most significant project thorough my time as Director of R&D at ZEROFAIL was the design of a complex Network Operations and Business Support System.
      - With the help of my devoted team, a scalable, asynchonous RPC system was built on the ZeroMQ messaging library so that workers can be added dynamically to scale to load without necessitating any changes to client configurations. <br>
        The python implementation leverages the new asynchronous programming tools available with recent versions of Python, including the new async/await syntax and the asynchronous iterator protocol.<br>
      - The system also leveraged a Graph Database system to enable very powerful queries that were used to facilitate operations. DataStax Enterprise database was chosen for that purpose, especially the new DataStax Enterprise Graph (DSE).<br>
        To interface with DSE the <a href="https://github.com/davebshow/goblin">"Goblin"</a> project was contributed to (the lead developper being part of my team).
      - This OSS/BOSS project and many others I designed and built with the development team helped ZEROFAIL reach higher levels of efficiency and enabled new sources of revenue.
    points:
      - Initiated and managed Research and development projects that provided new methods, solutions and improvement on existing services
      - Designed and led the developement of a complex Network Operations and Business Support System

    title: Director, Network Management Group
    text:
      - Due to the rapid growth of the telecommunication market in the Montreal area while I was Director of the Networking Group at ZEROFAIL, I had the opportunity to build a very extensive MPLS network accross Canada and the north of USA using cutting edge Juniper routers. <br>
        Very quickly, ZEROFAIL became a trusted source for connectivity services.
      - I designed the network to provide an edge over competition by making sure the whole infrastructure would have contingency plans in place in case of a problem - I wanted to build something that would stand by the name "ZEROFAIL".
      - To further improve the offering for highly available connectivity services, with the help of ZEROFAIL's CTO, I also designed and built the most extensive private wireless network in the metropolitain area of Montreal.<br>
      - Later on, ZEROFAIL added a portfolio of fiber connectivity services leveraging the concepts and technologies I had put in place.
    points:
      - Initiated and managed Research and development projects that provided new services and technologies that helped grow the business
