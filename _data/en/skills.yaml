      - My <b>interpersonal and relationship building skills</b> helped my co-workers realize that I was available for them and that I could help them achieve much more as a team than they would as an individual. <br/>
        Always willing to help, my <b>excellent leadership skills</b> have proven themselves useful many times when they would rely on me to help them reach their potential.
        Torough time, I also developped <b>strong communication skills</b> in order to listen effectively to my managers, co-workers or clients, communicate and facilitate discussions effectively with my team mates, prepare and deliver presentations, write documentation and so forth.
      - Being the critical thinker I am, my <b>very efficent researching skills</b> and my ability to unterstand things quickly sometimes put me in a position of mentor towards my team as I can easily analyse situations from multiple viewpoints and research matters to define key issues and explain them.
      - Overall, I am a <b>flexible team player</b> who prospers in a fast-paced, but organized, team work environment.
